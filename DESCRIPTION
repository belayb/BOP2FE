Description: Bayesian optimal design with futility and efficacy stopping boundaries (BOP2-FE) is a novel statistical framework for single-arm Phase II clinical trials. It enables early termination for efficacy when interim data are promising, while explicitly controlling Type I and Type II error rates. The design supports a variety of endpoint structures, including single binary endpoints, nested endpoints, co-primary endpoints, and joint monitoring of efficacy and toxicity. The package provides tools for enumerating stopping boundaries prior to trial initiation and for conducting simulation studies to evaluate the designâ€™s operating characteristics. Users can flexibly specify design parameters to suit their specific applications. For methodological details, refer to Xu et al. (2025) <doi:10.1080/10543406.2025.2558142>.
