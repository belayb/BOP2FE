\usage{
BOP2FE_coprimary(
  H0,
  n,
  lambda = NULL,
  gamma = NULL,
  eta = NULL,
  method = "power",
  nsim = NULL,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{H0}{Response rate under the null (Response - PFS6, Response - no PFS6, No response - PFS6, No response - No PFS6)}

\item{n}{vector of sample size at each interim look (Note that the sample size at interim i is the difference between sample size at interim i and at interim i-1)}

\item{lambda}{optimal value for lambda of the cut-off probability}

\item{gamma}{optimal value for gamma of the cut-off probability}

\item{eta}{optimal value for eta of the cut-off probability}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the method to use for calculating cutoff values.
Options are "power" (default) or "OF" for "O'Brien-Fleming".}

\item{nsim}{number of simulation}

\item{seed}{for reproducibility}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{"BOP2FE"} containing the following elements:
\item{boundary}{A table of stopping boundaries.}
\item{Oc}{A table of operating characteristics.}
\item{plot}{A plot that shows the boundaries graphically along with tables of 
boundary values and operating characteristics}
}
\description{
Computes stopping boundaries and operating characteristics of Bayesian optimal phase II
design with efficacy and futility stopping for a co-primary endpoint given optimal
design parameter values that are identified to optimize power while controlling
type I error rate at a specified value. The optimal parameters (i.e., lambda, gamma, and eta)
can be obtained by calling `Optimal_pars_coprimary()` function.
