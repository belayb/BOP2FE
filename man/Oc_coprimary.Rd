\usage{
Oc_coprimary(p1, p2, p3, p4, n, nsim, fb, sb, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{p1}{Response rate (Response - PFS6)}

\item{p2}{Response rate (Response - no PFS6)}

\item{p3}{Response rate (No response - PFS6)}

\item{p4}{Response rate (No response - no PFS6)}

\item{n}{A numeric vector representing the additional patients enrolled at each interim analysis. 
The value at index `i` indicates the number of new patients added at interim analysis `i`. 
The total sample size at interim `i` is the cumulative sum of the values in `n` up to that index. 
For example, for four interim analyses with total sample sizes of 10, 15, 20, and 30, 
the vector would be represented as `n = c(10, 5, 5, 10)`, where:
- 10 is the number of patients enrolled at interim 1,
- 5 (15 - 10) is the additional number of patients enrolled at interim 2,
- 5 (20 - 15) is the additional number of patients enrolled at interim 3,
- 10 (30 - 20) is the additional number of patients enrolled at interim 4.}

\item{nsim}{number of simulation}

\item{fb}{vector of futility boundary at each interim analysis specified 
in the following order: c(ORR_1, PFS6_1, ORR_2, PFS6_2, ORR_3, PFS6_3, ...)}

\item{sb}{vector of superiority boundary at each interim analysis specified 
in the following order: c(ORR_1, PFS6_1, ORR_2, PFS6_2, ORR_3, PFS6_3, ...)}

\item{seed}{for reproducibility}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns
\itemize{
\item{earlystopfuti_mean: }{Average number of early stopping due to futility}
 \item{earlystopsupe_mean: }{Average number of early stopping for futility due to efficacy}
  \item{ss_mean: }{Average sample size"} 
  \item{rejectnull_mean: }{"Average number of hypothesis rejection at the final analysis (aka Type-I error 
  if the response rate is the null rate or Power if the response rate is the alternative rate.} 
  \item{earlystopfuti_sum: }{Total number of early stopping due to futility} 
  \item{earlystopsupe_sum: }{Total number of early early stopping due to efficacy} 
  \item{ss_sum: }{Sum of sample sizes across simulation"} 
  \item{rejectnull_sum: }{Total number of hypothesis rejection at the final analysis} 
  }
