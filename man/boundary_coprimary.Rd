\usage{
boundary_coprimary(
  H0,
  a,
  n,
  lambda,
  gamma,
  eta = NULL,
  method = "power",
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{H0}{Response rate under the null (Response - PFS6, Response - no PFS6, No response - PFS6, No response - No PFS6)}

\item{a}{alpha values for the beta prior (i.e. usually set to the null response rate)}

\item{n}{A numeric vector representing the additional patients enrolled at each interim analysis. 
The value at index `i` indicates the number of new patients added at interim analysis `i`. 
The total sample size at interim `i` is the cumulative sum of the values in `n` up to that index. 
For example, for four interim analyses with total sample sizes of 10, 15, 20, and 30, 
the vector would be represented as `n = c(10, 5, 5, 10)`, where:
- 10 is the number of patients enrolled at interim 1,
- 5 (15 - 10) is the additional number of patients enrolled at interim 2,
- 5 (20 - 15) is the additional number of patients enrolled at interim 3,
- 10 (30 - 20) is the additional number of patients enrolled at interim 4.}

\item{lambda}{optimal value for lambda of the cut-off probability}

\item{gamma}{optimal value for gamma of the cut-off probability}

\item{eta}{optimal value for eta of the cut-off probability}

\item{method}{type of function to be used for the cut off probability for superiority. The default is "power" type function. method=OF is an alternative for "O'Brien-Fleming"}

\item{seed}{seed number}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns
\itemize{
\item{cn11f_max: }{Futility boundry for ORR}
 \item{cn11s_min: }{superiority boundry for PFS6}
  \item{cn11s_min: }{superiority boundry for ORR} 
  \item{cn12s_min: }{superiority boundry for PFS6} 
  }
