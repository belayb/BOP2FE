  H0,
  H1,
  n,
  nsim,

  gamma,
  eta = NULL,
  method = "power",

}
\arguments{
\item{H0}{A numeric vector representing the null response rates for different outcomes, specified in the following order:
- `H0[1]`: Complete Remission (CR) rate,
- `H0[2]`: Partial Remission (PR) rate,
- `H0[3]`: No Complete Remission or Partial Remission rate, calculated as `1 - (CR + PR)`.}

\item{H1}{A numeric vector representing the null response rates for different outcomes, specified in the following order:
- `H1[1]`: Complete Remission (CR) rate,
- `H1[2]`: Partial Remission (PR) rate,
- `H1[3]`: No Complete Remission or Partial Remission rate, calculated as `1 - (CR + PR)`.}

\item{n}{A numeric vector representing the additional patients enrolled at each interim analysis. 
The value at index `i` indicates the number of new patients added at interim analysis `i`. 
The total sample size at interim `i` is the cumulative sum of the values in `n` up to that index. 
For example, for four interim analyses with total sample sizes of 10, 15, 20, and 30, 
the vector would be represented as `n = c(10, 5, 5, 10)`, where:
- 10 is the number of patients enrolled at interim 1,
- 5 (15 - 10) is the additional number of patients enrolled at interim 2,
- 5 (20 - 15) is the additional number of patients enrolled at interim 3,
- 10 (30 - 20) is the additional number of patients enrolled at interim 4.}

\item{nsim}{number of simulation. A value at least 1000 for better result}

\item{lambda}{A numeric value for parameter `lambda` of the cut-off probability (i.e common for both efficacy and futility cut-off probability)}

\item{gamma}{A numeric value for parameter `gamma` of the cut-off probability for futility}

\item{eta}{A numeric value for parameter `eta` of the cut-off probability for efficacy}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the method to use for calculating cutoff values for the efficacy stoping.
Options are "power" (default) or "OF" for "O'Brien-Fleming".}

\item{seed}{for reproducibility}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns
\itemize{
\item{fut_boundary_CR_i: }{Futility boundary for CR at the ith analysis}
\item{fut_boundary_CR.PR_i: }{Futility boundary for CR/PR at the ith analysis}
\item{sup_boundary_CR_i: }{Superiority boundary for CR at the ith analysis}
\item{sup_boundary_CR.PR_i: }{Superiority boundary for CR/PRat the ith analysis}
\item{earlystopfuti_mean_h0: }{Average number of early stopping due to futility under the null hypothesis}
 \item{earlystopsupe_mean_h0: }{Average number of early stopping for futility due to efficacy under the null hypothesis}
  \item{ss_mean_h0: }{Average sample size under the null hypothesis} 
  \item{rejectnull_mean_h0: }{Average number of hypothesis rejection at the final analysis under the null hypothesis} 
  \item{earlystopfuti_mean_h1: }{Average number of early stopping due to futility under the alternative hypothesis} 
  \item{earlystopsupe_mean_h1: }{Average number of early early stopping due to efficacy under the alternative hypothesis} 
  \item{ss_mean_h1: }{Average sample size under the alternative hypothesis} 
  \item{rejectnull_mean_h1: }{Average number of hypothesis rejection at the final analysis under the alternative hypothesis}
