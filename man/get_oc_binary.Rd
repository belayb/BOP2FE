\usage{
get_oc_binary(p, n, nsim, fb, sb, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Response rate}

\item{n}{A numeric vector representing the additional patients enrolled at each interim analysis. 
The value at index `i` indicates the number of new patients added at interim analysis `i`. 
The total sample size at interim `i` is the cumulative sum of the values in `n` up to that index. 
For example, for four interim analyses with total sample sizes of 10, 15, 20, and 30, 
the vector would be represented as `n = c(10, 5, 5, 10)`, where:
 - 10 is the number of patients enrolled at interim 1,
 - 5 (15 - 10) is the additional number of patients enrolled at interim 2,
 - 5 (20 - 15) is the additional number of patients enrolled at interim 3,
 - 10 (30 - 20) is the additional number of patients enrolled at interim 4.}

\item{nsim}{number of simulation}

\item{fb}{vector/matrix of futility boundary at each interim analysis specified 
in the following order: c(f_1,..., f_{length(n)})}

\item{sb}{vector/matrix  of superiority boundary at each interim analysis specified 
in the following order: c(s_1,..., s_{length(n)})}

\item{seed}{for reproducibility}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns
\itemize{
\item{lambda: }{lambda values for cut-off probability}
\item{gamma: }{gamma valuesfor cut-off probability}
\item{eta: }{eta valuesfor cut-off probability}
\item{earlystopfuti_mean: }{Average number of early stopping due to futility}
 \item{earlystopsupe_mean: }{Average number of early stopping for futility due to efficacy}
  \item{ss_mean: }{Average sample size"} 
  \item{rejectnull_mean: }{"Average number of hypothesis rejection at the final analysis (aka Type-I error 
  if the response rate is the null rate or Power if the response rate is the alternative rate.} 
  \item{earlystopfuti_sum: }{Total number of early stopping due to futility} 
  \item{earlystopsupe_sum: }{Total number of early early stopping due to efficacy} 
  \item{ss_sum: }{Sum of sample sizes across simulation"} 
  \item{rejectnull_sum: }{Total number of hypothesis rejection at the final analysis} 
  }
